Game Thesis: Another World
================================

This repo will contain the source code, assets and supporting files for my thesis game, working title: "Another World". 

The game is in the style of a point-and-click adventure and aims to address some myths and stereotypes about refugees through its narrative about a boy who has to leave his homeworld. More about the story can be found on my blog: http://gamethesis.tumblr.com/

The game utilises the Javascript game framework Crafty (https://github.com/craftyjs/Crafty).

The latest game prototype can be found here: http://paxelated.com/anotherworld/

Framework
-----------

The Framework consists of a few main components (watch this space for updates):

* WalkTo component for player movement, including scrolling the viewport with the character's movement
* Dialogue component for interacting with other characters, reading the dialogue from a JSON file
* Doors for moving between scenes
* Item component for picking up and giving items (under construction)
